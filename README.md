# Random name generator
This small application was developed as a part of a technical test.

### Requirements
The app should allow the user to add and remove names to and from a list, and then press a button to randomly pick a name from the list. The same name should not be picked twice in a row. The name picked should be displayed in an easy way to read for the user.

It should also fit the following criteria:
- Must compile without errors
- Includes some form of state management
- Compiled code should run on Internet Explorer 11+
- Should utilise Webpack
